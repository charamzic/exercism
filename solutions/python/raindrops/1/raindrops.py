# - is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
# - is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
# - is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
# - **is not** divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.
#
# ## Examples
#
# - 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be `"Plong"`.
# - 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be `"PlingPlang"`.
# - 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be `"34"`.
